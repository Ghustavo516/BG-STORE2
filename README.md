# BG-Store

Welcome to BG-Store, a project developed by Gustavo Rodrigues and Beatriz Farah Marques as part of the learning process in the Embedded Systems Programming II discipline. Our goal is to provide a unique user experience by offering a product store with distinct categories accessible through simplified navigation in the top bar: Home, Electronics, Fashion, and Offers.

## Project Highlights

- **User Registration and Login:** BG-Store allows users to create personalized accounts and securely log in. During registration, we ensure verification of all fields, ensuring smooth integration into the system.

- **Purchase Simulation:** Using JavaScript, our page simulates the total purchase amount and displays the quantity of items in the cart. We provide an interactive and transparent experience to users, allowing them to view essential information before finalizing their purchases.

- **Dynamic Details:** By hovering over some products on the offers page, we provide brief descriptions, offering informative previews before the purchase decision.
